Summary

Each of the five perspectives addresses different dimensions of compliance risks and RegZ anomalies:

1. Behavioral: Captures consumer spending and payment behavior irregularities.


2. Volume and Velocity: Focuses on transactional flow, highlighting spikes, bursts, and outliers.


3. Fee and Charge Dynamics: Identifies undisclosed, excessive, or incorrectly applied fees and charges.


4. Geospatial and Merchant Analysis: Ensures consistency across locations and merchant categories.


5. Temporal Patterns and Relationships: Highlights anomalies tied to timing, billing cycles, and transaction processing.



Impact on RegZ Use Case

These features provide a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to identify:

Hidden charges and undisclosed fees.

Errors in billing, posting, and interest recalculations.

Fraudulent or non-compliant practices by merchants or processors.

Systematic inconsistencies in fee structures across accounts or geographies.


This holistic approach not only captures anomalies but also demonstrates advanced analytical thinking, showcasing a deep understanding of complex relationships relevant to RegZ compliance. If you need detailed code for these features, I can provide it as well!


























Here are 20 advanced features for your new transaction dataset, designed specifically to uncover anomalies and hidden insights related to RegZ (Regulation Z) use cases. These features are crafted to reveal patterns, inconsistencies, or behaviors that align with the regulatory focus on transparency, fairness, and accurate disclosures.

Key Notes:

1. Handling Missing or Zero Values:

Division by zero is avoided using 1e-9 in the denominators.

fillna() is used for rolling window operations where applicable.



2. Advanced Features:

Feature 8 (TCS): Uses clustering (KMeans) to segment transaction patterns, capturing shifts in spending behavior.

Feature 5 (AID) and Feature 8 (TCS): Use statistical and machine-learning methods to highlight outliers or irregularities.



3. Export and Verification:

Saves the final dataset with all 20 features to final_dataset_with_20_features.csv.

Prints a sample of the dataset to validate feature creation.




This code provides a complete implementation of all 20 features and aligns with the complexity and insights expected for an advanced APR-related use case under Reg Z compliance.


























\text{BCI} = \frac{\text{ytd_fees_amt} - \text{fix_pay_apr}}{\text{high_pay_amt}} ]

Why it’s important:
Evaluates consistency between fees, APR, and high payments. Reg Z requires transparent and fair billing disclosures; any inconsistency could result in customer overcharging or non-compliance.

Anomaly:
Large deviations in BCI could indicate misalignment in fee application or incorrect APR disclosures.


---

Summary of Anomaly Detection and Reg Z Implications

Each feature contributes to anomaly detection by addressing key areas of compliance under Reg Z:

1. Fairness: Features like APR Efficiency Ratio (APR_ER) and APR Spread Index (APRSI) detect unfair pricing or APR inconsistencies.


2. Transparency: Features like YTD Payment Ratio (YTD_PR), Billing Compliance Index (BCI), and Fee Impact Ratio (FIR) ensure proper fee and payment disclosures.


3. Accuracy: Features such as Anomalous Interest Detection (AID) and Refund Anomaly Detection (RAD) capture calculation errors that could mislead consumers.


4. Risk Management: Features like Foreign Transaction Risk Index (FTRI) and Delinquency Score (DS) highlight potential risk areas in APR determination and compliance.



These features provide a comprehensive, nuanced approach to detecting APR-related issues, going beyond surface-level insights to uncover hidden irregularities and potential compliance risks. This detailed analysis ensures robust monitoring and adherence to Reg Z regulations.
























Below is an approach for designing 20 advanced and insightful features based on the given datasets (profitability, transaction, and billing). Each feature is tailored to uncover hidden patterns, highlight anomalies, or provide actionable insights specifically for Reg Z compliance (related to disclosures, APR calculations, and anomalies in fees/transactions).


---

Feature Design and Rationale

Profitability Dataset Features

1. APR Efficiency Ratio (APR_ER)
Formula: 
Purpose: Captures the efficiency of purchases against the APR and creditworthiness. Higher anomalies indicate potential compliance issues.


2. Purchase Balance Volatility (PBV)
Formula: Rolling Standard Deviation of pure_purch_trans_bal_amt (time-based grouping simulated by transaction data).
Purpose: Sudden spikes or unusual stability in balances may indicate irregularities or user behavior anomalies.


3. Normalized Utilization (NU)
Formula: 
Purpose: Relates utilization to creditworthiness. Useful to identify disproportionate credit utilization against risk scores.


4. Point Efficiency Ratio (PER)
Formula: 
Purpose: Detects if points earned are consistent with purchases, revealing anomalies in promotional activity or misaligned rewards.


5. Anomalous Interest Detection (AID)
Formula: Outlier detection on interest using Z-scores.
Purpose: Identifies accounts with unusually high or low APR, critical for ensuring Reg Z compliance.




---

Transaction Dataset Features

6. Foreign Transaction Risk Index (FTRI)
Formula: 
Purpose: Highlights inconsistencies in foreign transactions. Outliers might indicate fraud or incorrect APR application.


7. Dynamic Fee Consistency (DFC)
Formula: 
Purpose: Tracks systemic consistency in fees and interest adjustments. Outliers could reveal billing irregularities.


8. Transaction Cluster Stability (TCS)
Formula: Apply k-means clustering on trans_amt and stlmt_rt; analyze cluster transition probabilities.
Purpose: Monitors transaction patterns; sudden transitions between clusters can indicate irregular spending.


9. Refund Anomaly Detection (RAD)
Formula: 
Purpose: Checks if refund values align with transaction amounts. Anomalies suggest potential chargebacks or disputes.


10. Point-of-Sale Risk Factor (POS_RF)
Formula: 
Purpose: Detects anomalies in location and mode of transaction, identifying possible skimming or fraud.




---

Billing Dataset Features

11. Payment-to-Credit Utilization (PCU)
Formula: 
Purpose: Tracks if payments are proportional to credit usage. Irregularities could indicate payment anomalies.


12. APR Stability Index (APR_SI)
Formula: 
Purpose: Analyzes how stable APR values are across billing periods, critical for Reg Z compliance.


13. Credit Limit Utilization Shift (CLUS)
Formula: 
Purpose: Detects shifts in credit limits, helping identify risky account adjustments.


14. YTD Payment Ratio (YTD_PR)
Formula: 
Purpose: Compares year-to-date payments with total sales. Large deviations may indicate compliance issues.


15. Delinquency Score (DS)
Formula: 
Purpose: Tracks delinquency risk by comparing balances to minimum payments.


16. APR Spread Index (APRSI)
Formula: 
Purpose: Analyzes disparities between purchase APR and cash APR, critical for pricing transparency.




---

Cross-Dataset Features

17. Revenue-to-APR Impact (RTAI)
Formula: 
Purpose: Relates profitability metrics to APR, helping identify accounts where APR is disproportionately high.


18. Fee Impact Ratio (FIR)
Formula: 
Purpose: Tracks fees' contribution to total charges, highlighting excessive or hidden fees.


19. Foreign APR Impact (FAI)
Formula: 
Purpose: Assesses if foreign transactions align with APR, identifying potential billing errors or compliance risks.


20. Billing Compliance Index (BCI)
Formula: 
Purpose: Comprehensive metric to capture irregularities in fees, APR, and payments, directly linked to Reg Z compliance.

New Features and Their Explanations

1. Interest Elasticity Index (IEI)

Formula:


Explanation:
This measures how sensitive the APR (interest rate) is to changes in credit usage. Anomalies occur if APR changes disproportionately to the utilized credit, indicating potential regulatory breaches in rate adjustments.


2. Fee-to-Limit Ratio (FTLR)

Formula:


Explanation:
A high FTLR indicates an excessive burden of fees relative to the credit limit. Unusually high values might indicate hidden APR increases or unfair fee structures that violate Reg Z.


3. Interest-to-Behavior Score Deviation (IBSD)

Formula:


Explanation:
Tracks how the relationship between APR and behavior score evolves. Significant deviations can signal anomalies, as behavior scores should influence APR consistently.


4. Adjusted Payment-to-Balance Ratio (APBR)

Formula:


Explanation:
Reflects how much of the purchase balance is being paid off versus fees. Sudden declines may indicate customers trapped in a fee-heavy structure, violating transparency obligations.


5. Time-Weighted APR Movement (TWAM)

Formula:


Explanation:
Measures APR changes over time. Anomalies occur if the APR increases too quickly, especially within short timeframes, suggesting a potential breach of re-evaluation timelines under Reg Z.


6. Fee Spike Indicator (FSI)

Formula:


Explanation:
Tracks sudden spikes in fees relative to the previous cycle. Sudden increases without a corresponding rise in balances might indicate hidden APR changes.


7. Credit Risk Spread (CRS)

Formula:

(APR Median = Median APR across similar customer profiles)

Explanation:
Identifies whether a customer’s APR deviates significantly from peers. Outliers suggest inconsistencies in APR application.


8. APR Non-Responsiveness (ANR)

Formula:


Explanation:
Measures whether APR changes align with credit usage changes. Lack of alignment may indicate a failure to re-evaluate rates per regulatory requirements.


9. Points Redemption Efficiency (PRE)

Formula:


Explanation:
Tracks whether points redemption aligns with earning. Disparities could reveal hidden penalizations or reward reductions tied to APR changes.


10. Regulatory Impact Factor (RIF)

Formula:


Explanation:
Reflects the total cost of borrowing. Unusually high values can suggest excessive fees and interest beyond acceptable limits.
