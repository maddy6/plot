1. Multi-Dimensional Velocity of High-Value Transactions
Concept: Calculate how quickly high-value transactions are made across different locations (e.g., post codes, terminals, countries). If a card performs high-value transactions at multiple places in a short period, it might signal location-based anomalies.
Formula: Rolling count of high-value transactions (>50% of credit limit) across different terminals and locations within a 1-hour interval.

Python Code:
python
Copy code
high_value_threshold = 0.5 * df['aqc_credit_limit']
high_value_tx = df[df['tca_mod_amt'] > high_value_threshold]
high_value_tx['high_value_velocity'] = high_value_tx.groupby('card_id')['tca_mod_amt'].rolling('1H').count()
high_value_tx['unique_terminals'] = high_value_tx.groupby('card_id')['hct_term_id'].transform(lambda x: x.nunique())

Python Code:
python
Copy code
df['pin_attempt_changes'] = df.groupby(['card_id', 'hct_term_id'])['ucm_pin_verify'].transform('nunique')

Python Code:
python
Copy code
high_value_transactions = df[df['tca_mod_amt'] > 0.5 * df['aqc_credit_limit']]
df['cross_currency_high_value_count'] = high_value_transactions.groupby('card_id')['currency'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling('1D').nunique())




8. Irregular AVS (Address Verification) Patterns with Declining Amount
Concept: Fraudsters may test cards with AVS mismatches, starting with low amounts and moving to high-value transactions.
Formula: Count of AVS mismatches with incremental transaction amounts.

Python Code:
python
Copy code
avs_mismatch = df[(df['ucm_avs_resp'] == 'failed') & (df['tca_mod_amt'] > 0.5 * df['aqc_credit_limit'])]
df['avs_mismatch_increasing_amt'] = avs_mismatch.groupby('card_id')['tca_mod_amt'].transform(lambda x: x.is_monotonic_increasing).sum()

I am working on a Anomaly Detection for Regulatory Obligations 


Problem Statement:
USPB (a department in Citibank) operates in a rapidly evolving regulatory and control environment. Banks are under increasing scrutiny for breaches in compliance related to customer obligations, regulatory obligations, and financial stability.

To proactively address these challenges, we aim to develop anomaly detection solutions that identify signals in the data, helping to uncover gaps before they become significant issues. The focus is on identifying breakdowns in our obligations as aligned with regulations and terms/conditions of our customer engagements.


---

Successful Outcome:
The solution should meet the following criteria:

1. Identify issues in the data exhaust that indicate a breakdown in obligations.


2. Replicability for repeated use in similar datasets.


3. Noise separation to distinguish material breakages from false positives.


4. Innovative approach in detecting anomalies.


5. Completeness, including documentation, reasoning, clean code, runtime needs, assumptions, and risk identification.




---

Evaluation Criteria:

Data Landscape:
Fines in the industry over the last 10 years highlight the criticality of anomaly detection:

1. Citi: $733MM+ (UDAAP) for misrepresenting fees and charging customers for services.


2. Citi: $335MM+ (Reg Z) for failing to re-evaluate APRs for eligible accounts.


3. Citi: $29MM+ (TCPA) for unauthorized robocalls.


4. Industry peers, including BoFA, Chase, and Wells Fargo, have also faced significant fines.
