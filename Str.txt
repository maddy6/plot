To create advanced strategies or rules for identifying fraudulent transactions without SME involvement, we need to devise systematic, scalable, and innovative approaches for rule generation and selection using the features in your dataset. Below is a very advanced and structured methodology:


---

1. Algorithmic Rule Mining (Association Rule Learning)

Apriori Algorithm:

Use the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent patterns in the data and translate them into fraud rules.

Example:

Generate rules like:

tca_mod_amt > 900 → fraud_ind = 1

hct_mer_mcc in (1124, 3544) → fraud_ind = 1



Adjust thresholds (e.g., support, confidence) to focus on high-fraud coverage while maintaining precision.


FP-Growth Algorithm:

Faster alternative to Apriori that finds frequent itemsets efficiently.

Use it to identify co-occurrences of variable conditions that are predictive of fraud.


Evaluation:

Rank the generated rules based on:

Fraud Recall (how much fraud is captured).

Precision (how many identified transactions are fraudulent).

Dollar-weighted metrics.




---

2. Optimization-Based Rule Discovery

Boolean Rule Learning (BRS):

Train a Boolean Rule Set model to learn interpretable if-else rules directly from the data.

Input: Features and fraud_ind.

Output: Compact rule sets optimized for precision and recall.


Optimization Formulation:

Define a cost function that balances fraud recall and false positives.

E.g., maximize:





Use solvers like:

Genetic Algorithms (GA): To explore combinations of conditions.

Simulated Annealing: For refining rule sets to maximize KPIs like Dollar Hit Rate.

3. Rule Discovery Using Explainable AI (XAI)

Decision Tree Rule Extraction:

Train a shallow decision tree on your data to extract human-readable rules.

Example:

If avg_spend_last_30days > 2000 AND tca_mod_amt > 900, then fraud = 1.



Prune the tree to reduce complexity while maintaining high recall.


SHAP-Based Rule Generation:

Use SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values to identify feature importance for predicting fraud.

Automatically generate rules based on high-impact feature thresholds.



---

4. Advanced Rule Induction Techniques

RuleFit Model:

Use RuleFit (an ensemble model combining linear models and decision rules) to:

Generate rules from decision trees within Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees.

Rank rules by importance.



Scalable Rule Induction with Ripper:

Train the Ripper (Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction) algorithm.

This is effective for large datasets and produces compact, interpretable rules.



---

5. Unsupervised Rule Discovery for Anomalies

Isolation-Based Clustering:

Use clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) to identify transaction clusters.

Find clusters with high fraud rates and translate their defining features into rules.


One-Class SVM:

Train a One-Class SVM to detect anomalous transactions.

Derive rules by analyzing the feature distributions of identified anomalies.



---

6. Heuristic and Human-Like Rule Exploration

Heuristic Scoring Framework:

Assign a "fraud score" to each feature.

Example:

If avs_resp=1, add 2 points.

If tca_mod_amt > 900, add 3 points.

If score > threshold → flag as fraud.



Use your data to determine scoring weights and thresholds.


Greedy Algorithm for Rule Selection:

Iteratively test combinations of features and thresholds to maximize fraud detection (e.g., by brute-forcing possible feature thresholds and evaluating KPIs).



---

7. Reinforcement Learning for Rule Refinement

Environment Setup:

Treat the rule generation process as a reinforcement learning problem:

State: Current rule set.

Action: Add/modify a rule.

Reward: Improvement in KPIs (Dollar Recall, Precision).



Deep Q-Learning for Rule Optimization:

Train a DQN to explore rule combinations efficiently.



---

8. Key Performance Indicator (KPI)-Driven Rule Evaluation

Metrics to Evaluate Rules:

1. Dollar Hit Rate: Total fraud captured / Total fraud.


2. Dollar Recall: Total fraud value flagged / Total fraud value.


3. Rule Efficiency: Number of fraudulent transactions captured / Total flagged transactions.


4. Coverage: Fraction of fraud cases captured by rules.



Cross-Validation:

Split the data temporally (e.g., by months) to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting rules to a specific period.



---

9. Automated Rule Deployment Framework

1. Rule Bank Creation:

Maintain a repository of discovered rules, ranked by performance.



2. Continuous Monitoring:

Periodically evaluate rule performance on live data.

Replace underperforming rules dynamically.



3. Visualization:

Build a dashboard to show:

Rule KPIs.

Fraud patterns uncovered by each rule.

Tools for Implementation

1. Python Libraries:

Scikit-Learn: Decision Trees, RuleFit.

PyCaret: AutoML for fraud prediction.

Mlxtend: Apriori and FP-Growth.



2. Optimization Libraries:

DEAP (Genetic Algorithms).

Optuna (Hyperparameter Optimization for Rule Generation).



3. Explainability:

SHAP, LIME.
