Proposal for Fraud Detection Model Segmentation
Key Insights
Metric	Internet Segment	Non-Internet Segments	Total
Transaction Share	35%	65%	100%
Fraud Count Share	80.3%	19.7%	100%
Fraud Amount Share	69.5%	30.5%	100%

Why Separate Models?
Challenges with Combined Model
Data Imbalance: Internet contributes 80.3% of fraud cases, skewing a combined model, reducing accuracy for non-internet segments.
Infrastructure Limitation: At a 1:9 ratio, 5-month data leads to 70M+ records, exceeding our capacity.
Advantages of Separate Models
Practicality: Allows focusing on non-internet segments with balanced datasets that fit infrastructure limits.
Compliance: Meets MRM sampling ratios (1:4, 1:9, 1:19) for both segments with adjusted timeframes.
Accuracy: Reduces noise from internet-dominated data, improving detection across diverse fraud types.
Sampling Plan
Segment	Fraud Count (3 Months)	Sampling Ratio	Dataset Size	Remarks
Non-Internet	700K	1:4	3.5M	Feasible and ensures balanced dataset.
1:9	6.3M	Fits with optimization.
1:19	12.6M	Manageable under infra limits.
Internet	3.0M	Advanced	>30M	Requires innovative sampling methods.
Impact of Internet Segment
Fraud Count: 80.3% of frauds concentrated in the internet segment, despite making up only 35% of transactions.
Fraud Amount: Contributes 69.5% of fraud-related losses, further skewing dataset dynamics.
Strategic Insight: Addressing internet fraud requires separate methodologies, avoiding adverse impacts on non-internet fraud detection.

Proposed Workflow
1. Non-Internet Model

Metric	Internet	Non-Internet
Conclusion
Separate Models Enable Scalability: Addresses infrastructure constraints and ensures model compliance.
Improved Accuracy: Dedicated models for distinct fraud behaviors optimize performance.
Strategic Insight: Tailored methodologies provide a stronger defense against fraud for both internet and non-internet segments.



Non-Internet Model is computationally feasible and effective across required sampling ratios.
Internet Model can use specialized methods to address high fraud concentration, avoiding skewed insights.
This modular approach balances resource optimization, compliance, and accuracy, ensuring robust fraud detection for all segments.
