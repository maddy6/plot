1. Text Preprocessing Using spaCy
First, let's update the preprocessing using spaCy for tasks like tokenization, removing stopwords, and punctuation.

Code: Text Preprocessing with spaCy
python
Copy code
import spacy
import re
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Load spaCy's English language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Example of a complaint column 'complaint_text' with long strings
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Clean text: convert to lowercase, remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-z\s]', '', text.lower())
    
    # Tokenize and remove stopwords using spaCy
    doc = nlp(text)
    tokens = [token.text for token in doc if not token.is_stop and not token.is_punct]
    
    # Join tokens back to a single string
    cleaned_text = ' '.join(tokens)
    return cleaned_text

# Example dataset (replace with your actual data)
dummy_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'complaint_text': ['This is a complaint about robocalls.', 'I am tired of receiving unsolicited marketing calls.', 'Too many telemarketer calls!']
})

# Apply preprocessing to the complaint column
dummy_data['processed_complaint'] = dummy_data['complaint_text'].apply(preprocess_text)
print(dummy_data[['complaint_text', 'processed_complaint']])
2. TF-IDF Vectorization
You can use CountVectorizer to convert the processed complaint data into a bag-of-words representation.

Code: TF-IDF Vectorization
python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Use TF-IDF to represent text data
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=20)  # You can adjust the number of features
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(dummy_data['processed_complaint'])

# Convert to a DataFrame for easier analysis
complaint_features = pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(complaint_features.head())
3. Sentiment Analysis Using TextBlob
TextBlob is a simple library for text processing and sentiment analysis. You can use it to classify complaints as positive, negative, or neutral.

Code: Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob
python
Copy code
from textblob import TextBlob
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Function to analyze sentiment using TextBlob
def get_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    return blob.sentiment.polarity  # Returns a polarity score (-1 to 1)

# Apply sentiment analysis to the complaint data
dummy_data['sentiment_score'] = dummy_data['complaint_text'].apply(get_sentiment)

# Classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score
dummy_data['sentiment'] = dummy_data['sentiment_score'].apply(lambda x: 'positive' if x > 0 else ('negative' if x < 0 else 'neutral'))

# Plot sentiment distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x='sentiment', data=dummy_data, palette='coolwarm')
plt.title('Sentiment of Complaints')
plt.xlabel('Sentiment')
plt.ylabel('Number of Complaints')
plt.show()

print(dummy_data[['complaint_text', 'sentiment']])
4. Topic Modeling Using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
You can use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the main topics in complaints.

Code: Topic Modeling with LDA
python
Copy code
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Define the number of topics (e.g., 5 different types of complaints)
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=5, random_state=42)
lda_topics = lda.fit_transform(X)

# Create a DataFrame for the topics
lda_df = pd.DataFrame(lda_topics, columns=[f'Topic {i+1}' for i in range(5)])

# Show the top words for each topic
for index, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):
    print(f"Topic {index+1}:")
    print([vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()[i] for i in topic.argsort()[-10:]])
5. Named Entity Recognition (NER) Using spaCy
You can use spaCy's built-in Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract entities like company names, dates, and locations from the complaint data.

Code: Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy
python
Copy code
import spacy

# Load the spaCy English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Function to extract named entities from complaint
def extract_entities(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents]
    return entities

# Apply the function to the complaint data
dummy_data['complaint_entities'] = dummy_data['complaint_text'].apply(extract_entities)

# Show the extracted entities
print(dummy_data[['complaint_text', 'complaint_entities']])
6. Text Classification (Naive Bayes Classifier)
You can classify the complaints into predefined categories such as harassment, robocalls, etc., using Naive Bayes.

Code: Text Classification Using Naive Bayes
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Example: Assigning labels based on complaint type (you can define your own categories)
dummy_data['complaint_label'] = dummy_data['complaint_text'].apply(lambda x: 'harassment' if 'harass' in x else 'robocall')

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, dummy_data['complaint_label'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train the Naive Bayes model
nb = MultinomialNB()
nb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
y_pred = nb.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Key Explanations for Each Step:
Text Preprocessing with spaCy: We used spaCy for tokenization, stopword removal, and punctuation removal. It helps in cleaning and preparing the text for further analysis.

TF-IDF Vectorization: TF-IDF is used to convert the text data into numerical representations while considering the significance of each word in the document. This is crucial for analyzing and clustering complaints.

Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob: TextBlob provides an easy way to perform sentiment analysis on text. We classified the complaints based on sentiment, which helps in identifying negative sentiments tied to potential TCPA violations.

Topic Modeling with LDA: LDA allows you to discover hidden topics in your complaint data, which can be helpful in understanding what types of complaints are most common and linked to potential TCPA issues.

NER with spaCy: By extracting named entities, you can gain insights into important keywords in the complaints, such as company names, dates, and locations that may be associated with violations or customer pain-points.

Text Classification with Naive Bayes: By classifying complaints into categories (e.g., robocalls, harassment), you can better understand which types of complaints are likely associated with TCPA violations.
