1. Risk-Amplified Feature Interactions
Fraudulent activity often involves specific risk features amplifying one another. This feature captures interaction magnitudes beyond simple addition or multiplication.

Feature: Risk Cross-Amplification Index
python
Copy code
df['risk_cross_amplification'] = (
    (df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] + df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk']) *
    (df['ucm_avs_resp_baysian_risk'] + df['hct_term_state_baysian_risk'])
)
Why?

Fraudsters target weak points like specific merchants (hct_mer_mcc) or countries (hct_term_country_code) while exploiting technical gaps like AVS mismatches (ucm_avs_resp).
Combining these risks amplifies fraud potential when multiple weaknesses overlap.
How? This feature highlights cases where combined vulnerabilities create hotspots for fraud.

2. Nonlinear Multi-Risk Scaling
Captures nonlinear dependencies among high-risk features, emphasizing extreme cases where risk scores independently spike.

Feature: Exponential Risk Profile
python
Copy code
df['exp_risk_profile'] = np.exp(
    (df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] + df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk'] +
     df['ucm_avs_resp_baysian_risk'] + df['hct_term_state_baysian_risk']) / 4
)
Why? Fraud rarely occurs in linear patterns; instead, risks spike exponentially when combined.

How? By applying an exponential transformation, this feature emphasizes extreme risks while de-emphasizing benign activity.

3. Weighted Behavioral Divergence
Measures divergence between risk-weighted features and standard behavioral features, surfacing anomalies.

Feature: Risk-Behavior Divergence
python
Copy code
df['risk_behavior_divergence'] = abs(
    df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] - df['cnt_sameamt_auth_6h']
) / (df['tot_cnt_30min'] + 1)
Why? Fraudulent activity often deviates from normal behavior, such as performing repeated transactions at high-risk merchants.

How? This feature calculates the gap between risk scores and real-world behavioral patterns, surfacing anomalies when mismatched.

4. Sequential Probability Scores
Captures cascading risks by modeling sequences across multiple indicators.

Feature: Sequential Risk Cascade
python
Copy code
df['seq_risk_cascade'] = (
    df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] * 
    df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk'] *
    df['ucm_avs_resp_baysian_risk']
)
Why? Fraud often involves "domino effect" risks where multiple vulnerabilities align, like risky merchants and AVS mismatches on international transactions.

How? Sequential multiplication emphasizes cases where risks align in a cascading pattern.

5. Relative Risk Contribution
Calculates the proportion of risk contributed by each individual feature to the overall profile.

Feature: Risk Contribution Score
python
Copy code
df['risk_contribution_hct_mer_mcc'] = (
    df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] /
    (df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] + df['hct_term_state_baysian_risk'] +
     df['ucm_avs_resp_baysian_risk'] + df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk'] + 1e-6)
)
Why? Fraud profiles often revolve around a dominant feature, like a specific merchant type, AVS mismatch, or geographic risk.

How? This feature isolates each riskâ€™s proportional contribution, helping pinpoint the fraud-driving factor.

6. Risk Density Features
Measures "density" of risk across multiple dimensions to surface high-risk regions.

Feature: Risk Density Score
python
Copy code
df['risk_density'] = (
    (df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] * df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk']) /
    (df['cnt_trxns_60days'] + df['tot_cnt_2hr'] + 1)
)
Why? Fraud often involves repeated transactions (dense activity) within high-risk profiles.

How? Risk scores are normalized by transaction counts, highlighting cases with concentrated risk despite normal activity levels.

7. Risk Coherence Index
Measures coherence between risks, identifying misalignments that could signify fraud.

Feature: Risk Coherence Index
python
Copy code
df['risk_coherence'] = (
    (df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] + df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk']) /
    abs(df['ucm_avs_resp_baysian_risk'] - df['hct_term_state_baysian_risk'] + 1e-6)
)
Why? Fraud often exploits gaps in aligned security measures, like geographic risk and AVS mismatches.

How? This feature detects when risks are incoherent (e.g., a risky country but no AVS mismatch), a potential fraud indicator.

8. Cross-Risk Momentum
Captures "momentum" by comparing risk scores across key features.

Feature: Cross-Risk Momentum
python
Copy code
df['cross_risk_momentum'] = (
    (df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] - df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk']) *
    (df['ucm_avs_resp_baysian_risk'] - df['hct_term_state_baysian_risk'])
)
Why? Fraud patterns evolve quickly, often showing rapid changes across correlated risk dimensions.

How? This feature surfaces momentum by detecting mismatched changes in risk.

9. Weighted Risk Overlap
Quantifies overlapping high-risk features with different weights.

Feature: Weighted Overlap Score
python
Copy code
df['weighted_risk_overlap'] = (
    0.5 * df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk'] + 
    0.3 * df['hct_term_country_code_baysian_risk'] +
    0.2 * df['ucm_avs_resp_baysian_risk']
)
Why? Fraudulent transactions often exploit multiple weighted vulnerabilities.

How? By weighting risks, the feature focuses on the most critical contributors.

10. Nonlinear Interactions with Zero-Authorization
Nonlinear relationships between high-risk scores and zero-authorization mismatches.

Feature: Nonlinear Zero-Auth Interaction
python
Copy code
df['nonlinear_zero_auth'] = np.sqrt(
    df['cnt_za_mis_24hr'] * df['hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk']
)
Why? Zero-authorization mismatches combined with risky merchants are strong indicators of fraud.

How? Square root transformation emphasizes higher mismatch values while reducing noise.

Why These Features Could Rank High in Feature Importance:
Complex Relationships: These features go beyond simple arithmetic and linear combinations by modeling nonlinear, hierarchical, or amplified interactions.
Fraud Patterns: They are tailored to fraud-specific behaviors, such as sequential risks, concentration patterns, and deviations.
Focus on Key Variables: By emphasizing critical risks (hct_mer_mcc_baysian_risk, etc.), these features align with already proven high-importance indicators.
