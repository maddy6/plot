1. Text Preprocessing with Regular Expressions (Regex)
We will use regular expressions for text cleaning (removing punctuation, numbers, and extra spaces) and convert the text to lowercase.

Code: Text Preprocessing with Regular Expressions
python
Copy code
import re
import pandas as pd

# Example dataset (replace with your actual data)
dummy_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'complaint_text': ['This is a complaint about robocalls.', 
                       'I am tired of receiving unsolicited marketing calls.', 
                       'Too many telemarketer calls!']
})

# Function to clean the text (remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, etc.)
def clean_text(text):
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text.lower())  # Remove non-alphabetic characters
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()  # Remove extra spaces
    return text

# Apply text cleaning to the 'complaint_text' column
dummy_data['processed_complaint'] = dummy_data['complaint_text'].apply(clean_text)

# Show cleaned text
print(dummy_data[['complaint_text', 'processed_complaint']])
2. Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob
We will use TextBlob for simple sentiment analysis to classify complaints into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This is effective for identifying complaints related to TCPA violations.

Code: Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob
python
Copy code
from textblob import TextBlob
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Function to calculate sentiment polarity using TextBlob
def get_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    return blob.sentiment.polarity  # Returns polarity score (-1 to 1)

# Apply sentiment analysis to the processed complaint text
dummy_data['sentiment_score'] = dummy_data['processed_complaint'].apply(get_sentiment)

# Classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral
dummy_data['sentiment'] = dummy_data['sentiment_score'].apply(lambda x: 'positive' if x > 0 else ('negative' if x < 0 else 'neutral'))

# Plot the distribution of sentiment
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x='sentiment', data=dummy_data, palette='coolwarm')
plt.title('Sentiment Distribution of Complaints')
plt.xlabel('Sentiment')
plt.ylabel('Number of Complaints')
plt.show()

# Show the data with sentiment labels
print(dummy_data[['complaint_text', 'sentiment']])
3. Frequency Analysis and Word Cloud (for Topics)
We will use CountVectorizer to extract the most frequent words and create a word cloud to visualize the most frequent terms related to complaints.

Code: Frequency Analysis with CountVectorizer and Word Cloud
python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Initialize CountVectorizer to get the top frequent words
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=20)  # Limit to top 20 words
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(dummy_data['processed_complaint'])

# Get the top words
top_words = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# Generate a word cloud
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(dict(zip(top_words, X.sum(axis=0).tolist()[0])))

# Display the word cloud
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
4. Basic Topic Modeling with Bag of Words
Although we won’t use complex models like LDA, we can still perform basic topic modeling by using CountVectorizer to extract frequent terms.

Code: Basic Topic Modeling with Bag of Words
python
Copy code
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Initialize LDA model to find topics
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=3, random_state=42)  # Let's find 3 topics
lda_topics = lda.fit_transform(X)

# Show the top words for each topic
n_top_words = 10
for index, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):
    print(f"Topic {index + 1}:")
    print([top_words[i] for i in topic.argsort()[-n_top_words:]])

# You can also visualize the topics using a bar chart or further analysis
5. Named Entity Recognition with Regular Expressions
Instead of spaCy, we can use regular expressions to identify potential named entities like company names, locations, and dates (though more complex NER would require a specialized model, this is a simplified version).

Code: Simple Named Entity Recognition (with Regex)
python
Copy code
import re

# Function to find potential named entities (e.g., company names, locations, and dates)
def extract_named_entities(text):
    # Simplified pattern to find capitalized words (potential entities)
    return re.findall(r'\b[A-Z][a-z]*\b', text)

# Apply entity extraction
dummy_data['entities'] = dummy_data['complaint_text'].apply(extract_named_entities)

# Show the entities found in complaints
print(dummy_data[['complaint_text', 'entities']])
6. Simple Classification of Complaints Using Keywords
You can classify complaints into categories such as "robocalls" or "harassment" by checking for keywords in the complaint text.

Code: Simple Keyword-based Classification
python
Copy code
def classify_complaint(text):
    if 'robocall' in text or 'telemarketing' in text:
        return 'Robocall/Telemarketing'
    elif 'harassment' in text:
        return 'Harassment'
    else:
        return 'Other'

# Apply the classification function
dummy_data['complaint_category'] = dummy_data['processed_complaint'].apply(classify_complaint)

# Show the categorized complaints
print(dummy_data[['complaint_text', 'complaint_category']])
Key Explanations for Each Step:
Text Preprocessing with Regex: This simple approach removes unwanted characters and normalizes text (e.g., lowercasing) to ensure clean data for further analysis.

Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob: By analyzing the polarity of complaints, we can categorize complaints into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Negative complaints can point to potential TCPA violations.

Frequency Analysis & Word Cloud: Using CountVectorizer, we can identify the most frequent terms in complaints and visualize them through a word cloud, helping to understand common issues (e.g., “robocall,” “telemarketing”).

Topic Modeling with Bag of Words: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to discover potential topics in complaints, helping identify common themes or issues.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Using regular expressions, we extract capitalized words which might represent named entities like companies or locations.

Complaint Classification: A simple approach is used to classify complaints into predefined categories like Robocalls or Harassment based on keyword matching.
