I have participated in a Anomaly detection Hackathon in my company (Citibank corp)


Problem Statement: USPB(One of the Dept in Citibank) is in a rapidly evolving regulatory and control environment. Banks have been subject to increasing scrutiny for breaches in their compliance towards customer obligations, Regulatory obligations and stability obligations. 

We are looking to get ahead of these evolving events by looking at signals in the data that can help us identify gaps to them becoming real issues.

the focus will be to identify issues within customer data exhaust that represent a breakdown of our obligations either aligned to Regulations and Terms/Conditions of our customer engagements.


Successful Outcome:
Successful Outcome should deliver solutions that meets the following criteria-
1. Ability to identify issues in the data exhaust that indicate break in the obligation
2. Be repeatable in term of application
3. Reflect ability to separate noise from material breakages
4. Innovative or thorough in the approach to identifying target areas of breakages
5. completeness - Documentation, Reasoning, Clean Code, Run time needs, assumptions, risks


Evaluation Criterion and other inputs:
Criteria     Weightage
Solution Innovativeness 25
Completeness 25
Re-usability and scalability 10
code and analytics quality 15
Impact - High level Sizing- Customer, Fine, estimates based on data - 25



They have given some background info related to fines 
Landscape of industry breaks and fines over last 10 years

6. Billing Statements



Now we need to develop method/technique for Anomaly detection where a set algorithms (Modeling/Non Modeling/Rule based ) which is replicable & scalable.

I need based on the Data provided which all possible use cases we can create and then which Anomaly detection methods can be used for those use cases. I have already provide the use cases they have given (It is mostly rule driven use case they have provided). I want all sorts of solutions. For the modeling they specifically mentioned it is a unsupervised problem as there is no tagging available. 


For Data Part I will provide the detailed variables they have provide under each section. Whenever you require it , just let me know. I will give you full list of variables/features under each data set. 

Now My AIM is to won the competition by providing highly robust, scalable solution. Please help me accordingly w.r.t my all above points.

I need something concrete use cases . Also for data creation part i will provide you detailed list of features under each dataset. Once you finalize the use cases, detailed approaches for each use cases, Why, how and their implementation, impact etc. Give me detailed info on all aspects please.
