Letâ€™s address the importance sampling strategy for your specific dataset (Internet and Non-Internet segments) while focusing on ensuring unbiased representation and addressing seasonality concerns.

1. Dataset Overview

1.1 Internet Segment

Dataset Size: 900 million records.

Fraud Rate: 0.5% (~4.5 million fraud cases).

Frauds per Month: ~1 million.

Challenge:

High fraud volume requires computationally efficient sampling.

Potential for seasonality or bias in the data (e.g., certain months might have higher fraud activity due to holidays or cyber events).



1.2 Non-Internet Segment

Dataset Size: 1.4 billion records.

Fraud Rate: 0.2% (~2.8 million fraud cases).

Frauds per Month: ~200,000.

Challenge:

Relatively lower fraud volume, making the dataset easier to handle.

Need for consistency in sampling techniques across both segments.



Key Issue for MRM

The model must address temporal biases or seasonality from 5 months of data.

The sampling methodology must ensure fraud patterns are accurately captured and generalizable.

2. Advanced Importance Sampling for Your Data

Step 1: Temporal Analysis to Identify Bias or Seasonality

A. Temporal Fraud Rate Analysis

1. Monthly Fraud Rate Trends:

Break down fraud rates per month (for both Internet and Non-Internet segments).

Identify spikes or dips in fraud cases (e.g., higher frauds during December holiday shopping in the Internet segment).

Use statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to detect significant month-to-month variations in fraud rates.



2. Feature Drift Analysis Over Time:

Track key features over 5 months for fraud and non-fraud cases:

Transaction amount.

Merchant category.

Transaction time and date.


Use Population Stability Index (PSI) to measure drift:




PSI = \sum \left( \frac{Actual}{Total} - \frac{Expected}{Total} \right) \log \left( \frac{\frac{Actual}{Total}}{\frac{Expected}{Total}} \right)

B. Visualization

Create time-series plots for fraud rates and key feature distributions (e.g., transaction amounts).

Highlight consistent trends versus seasonal spikes.

Step 2: Assign Importance Weights

A. Feature-Based Weights

Identify features strongly correlated with fraud for each segment:

Internet Segment: Look for unusual transaction amounts, IP address anomalies, device IDs.

Non-Internet Segment: Analyze transaction types (e.g., chip, 3DS, wallet), merchant categories, and manually keyed transactions.


Feature Importance Methods:

1. Shapley Values (SHAP):

Calculate SHAP values for each feature using a baseline model (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting).

Assign higher weights to samples with features showing high fraud risk.



2. Mutual Information:

Compute mutual information between each feature and the fraud target label.

Features with higher scores receive higher weights.





B. Temporal Weights

Adjust weights to account for any identified seasonality:

Underrepresented months (with lower fraud rates) are given higher weights.

Overrepresented months (with excessive fraud cases) are down-weighted.


Composite Weight Formula:


W_i = W_{feature} \times W_{time}

: Temporal adjustment weight.



---

Step 3: Implement Sampling

A. Weighted Sampling

Use the computed weights to sample transactions, ensuring fraud patterns are preserved.

Ensure the sampled dataset maintains the original fraud ratios:

Internet: 0.5%.

Non-Internet: 0.2%.



B. Sampling Ratio

Choose a manageable sampling ratio based on computational constraints:

Start with a ratio of 1:9 or 1:19 for fraud to non-fraud cases.

Adjust based on infrastructure capabilities.

3. Validation to Satisfy MRM Concerns

3.1. Statistical Validation

A. Temporal Stability

Compare fraud rates and feature distributions in the sampled dataset versus the original dataset for each segment.

Use Chi-Square or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to verify representativeness:

Null Hypothesis: The sampled data is representative of the original population.

Significance Level: 0.05.



B. Feature Distribution Stability

Compare the distribution of key features (e.g., transaction amount, merchant type) between the original and sampled datasets.

Use KL Divergence:


D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}

: Sampled feature distribution.

: Acceptable similarity.


C. Population Stability Index (PSI)

Calculate PSI for key features across the original and sampled datasets:

PSI < 0.1: No significant drift.

PSI < 0.2: Moderate drift, may require adjustment.




---

3.2. Model Validation

A. Train-Test Consistency

Train your fraud detection model on the stratified sample.

Test it on:

Out-of-Time (OOT) data (e.g., a held-out month).

The original dataset.


Compare metrics (AUC-ROC, precision, recall) across:

Sampled data.

OOT data.

Original population.



B. Performance Stability

Perform bootstrap sampling from the stratified sample.

Train the model on multiple bootstrap samples and check performance consistency:

Average AUC-ROC, precision, and recall over all iterations.

Small standard deviation indicates robustness.

4. Addressing MRM Concerns

A. Statistical Evidence

Present statistical test results (e.g., PSI, Chi-Square, KL Divergence) showing that:

The sampled data represents the original population.

Fraud patterns are preserved.



B. Temporal Stability

Show time-series plots of fraud rates and feature distributions proving uniform representation across all months.


C. Model Performance

Compare AUC-ROC, precision, and recall on sampled data, original population, and OOT data.

Highlight consistent performance across all datasets.


D. Explainability

Justify the importance sampling methodology:

Combines feature-based and temporal weighting.

Balances computational efficiency with representativeness.
