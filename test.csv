"Threat Centric Network Access Control (TC-NAC) feature enables you to create authorization policies based on the threat and vulnerability attributes received from the threat and vulnerability adapters. Threat severity levels and vulnerability assessment results can be used to dynamically control the access level of an endpoint or a user.
You can configure the vulnerability and threat adapters to send high fidelity Indications of Compromise (IoC), Threat Detected events, and CVSS scores to Cisco ISE, so that threat-centric access policies can be created to change the privilege and context of an endpoint accordingly.

Step 11   Click Finish.
Note 
CTA works with user identities listed in the web proxy logs as IP addresses or usernames. Specifically, in the case of IP addresses, the IP address of a device that is available through the proxy logs may collide with the IP address of another device on the internal network. For example, roaming users connected via AnyConnect and a split-tunnel directly to the internet could acquire a local IP range address (for example, 10.0.0.X address), which may collide with an address in an overlapping private IP range used in an internal network. We recommend that you take into account the logical network architecture while defining the policies to avoid quarantine actions being applied on mismatched devices.

"You can use the CTA-Course_Of_Action attribute to configure authorization policies for the endpoints for which threat events are reported. This attribute is available in the Threat directory.

You can also create exception rules based on the CTA-Course_Of_Action attribute.

Step 1   Choose Policy > Policy Sets You can edit an existing policy rule or create a new exception rule for the endpoints with threat events.
Step 2   Create a condition to check for the CTA-Course_Of_Action attribute value and assign the appropriate authorization profile. For example:
Network_Access_Authentication_Passed AND ThreatCTA-Course_Of_Action CONTAINS Internal Blocking then blocking (authorization profile)

Note    
""Internal Blocking"" is the recommended Course of Action attribute to be used for quarantining the endpoints.

Step 3   Click Save.
When a threat event is received for an endpoint, Cisco ISE checks if there is any matching authorization policy for the endpoint and triggers CoA only if the endpoint is active. If the endpoint is offline, threat event details are added to the Threat Events report (Operations > Reports > Threat Centric NAC > Threat Events).

Note 
Sometimes CTA sends multiple risks and their associated Course of Action attributes in one incident. For example, it can send ""Internal Blocking"" and ""Monitoring"" (course of action attributes) in one incident. In this case, if you have configured an authorization policy to quarantine endpoints using ""equals"" operator, the endpoints will not be quarantined. For example:

CTA-Course_Of_Action EQUALS Internal Blocking then Quarantine_Systems (authorization profile)

In such cases, you must use ""contains"" operator in the authorization policy to quarantine the endpoints. For example:

"Cisco Identity Services Engine integrates with the following Vulnerability Assessment (VA) Ecosystem Partners to obtain vulnerability results of endpoints that connect to the Cisco ISE network:

Qualys—Qualys is a cloud-based assessment system with scanner appliances deployed in the network. Cisco ISE allows you to configure an adapter that communicates with Qualys and obtains the VA results. You can configure the adapter from the Admin portal. You need a Cisco ISE administrator account with Super Admin privileges to configure the adapter. The Qualys adapter uses REST APIs to communicate with the Qualys Cloud Service. You need a user account in Qualys with Manager privileges to access the REST APIs. Cisco ISE uses following Qualys REST APIs :
Host Detection List API—To check the last scan results of the endpoint
Scan API—To trigger an on-demand scan of the endpoint
Qualys enforces limits on the number of API calls that subscribed users can make. The default rate limit count is 300 per 24 hours. Cisco ISE uses Qualys API version 2.0 to connect to Qualys. Refer to the Qualys API V2 User Guide for more information on these API functions.
Rapid7 Nexpose—Cisco ISE integrates with Rapid 7 Nexpose, a vulnerability management solution, to help detect vulnerabilities and enables you to respond to such threats quickly. Cisco ISE receives the vulnerability data from Nexpose and based on the policies that you configure in ISE, it quarantines the affected endpoints. From the Cisco ISE dashboard, you can view the affected endpoint and take appropriate action.
Cisco ISE has been tested with Nexpose Release 6.4.1.
Tenable Security Center (Nessus scanner)—Cisco ISE integrates with Tenable SecurityCenter and receives the vulnerability data from Tenable Nessus scanner (managed by Tenable SecurityCenter) and based on the policies that you configure in ISE, it quarantines the affected endpoints. From the Cisco ISE dashboard, you can view the affected endpoints and take appropriate action.
Cisco ISE has been tested with Tenable SecurityCenter 5.3.2.
The results from the ecosystem partner are converted in to a Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) representation and based on this value, a Change of Authorization (CoA) is triggered, if needed, and the appropriate level of access is granted to the endpoint.

The time taken to assess endpoints for vulnerabilities depends on various factors and hence VA cannot be performed in real time. The factors that affect the time taken to assess an endpoint for vulnerabilities include:

Vulnerability assessment ecosystem
Type of vulnerabilities scanned for
Type of scans enabled
Network and system resources allocated by the ecosystem for the scanner appliances
In this release of Cisco ISE, only endpoints with IPv4 addresses can be assessed for vulnerabilities.

",How do I configure the Tenable adapter?,"You must create a Tenable adapter for Cisco ISE to communicate with Tenable SecurityCenter (Nessus scanner) and obtain the VA results.

Before You Begin
Note: You must configure the following in Tenable SecurityCenter before you can configure the Tenable Adapter in Cisco ISE. Refer to Tenable SecurityCenter Documentation for these configurations.

• You must have Tenable Security Center and Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner installed. While registering the Tenable Nessus scanner, ensure that you choose Managed by SecurityCenter in the Registration field.
• Create a user account with Security Manager privilege in Tenable SecurityCenter.
• Create a repository in SecurityCenter (Log in to Tenable SecurityCenter with Admin credentials and choose Repository > Add).
• Add the endpoint IP range to be scanned in the repository.
• Add Nessus scanner.
• Create scan zones and assign IP addresses to the scan zones and scanners that are mapped to these scan zones.
• Create a scan policy for ISE.
• Add an active scan and associate it with the ISE scan policy. Configure settings, targets (IP/DNS names).
• Export System and Root certificates from Tenable SecurityCenter and import it in to the Trusted Certificates store in Cisco ISE (Administration > Certificates > Certificate Management > Trusted Certificates > Import). Ensure that the appropriate root and intermediate certificates are imported (or present) in the Cisco ISE Trusted Certificates store.
• Cisco ISE communicates with Tenable SecurityCenter over HTTPS/SSL (port 443).
