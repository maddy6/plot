    "How it helps: By analyzing the frequency of transaction types, you can detect patterns where certain transaction types are more prevalent than expected, indicating potential RegZ violations related to non-disclosure of APR rates for specific types of transactions.\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['loan_fee_ratio'] = df['loan_cap_amt'] / df['ca_fee_amt']\n",
    "Why?: This ratio can indicate if the fees are reasonable in relation to the loan cap. RegZ requires that the loan fees and APR be disclosed accurately. If fees are disproportionately high compared to the loan amount, it could violate RegZ rules.\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",

    "Why?: RegZ requires that interest rates, fees, and APR disclosures be consistent and transparent. Tracking changes in APR over time can help identify irregular adjustments that might be non-compliant.\n",
    "How it helps: Detects sudden or unexplained changes in APR or interest rates, which might violate RegZ if not properly disclosed to consumers.\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['ltv_ratio'] = df['loan_cap_amt'] / df['transaction_amount']\n",
    "Why?: The LTV ratio is an important factor in determining the risk of a loan. In RegZ, any changes in loan terms (such as APR) based on the LTV ratio need to be clearly disclosed. High LTV ratios might indicate riskier loans, which could warrant a higher APR.\n",
    "How it helps: Identifies situations where high LTV ratios might lead to higher APRs that are not properly disclosed, violating RegZ rules.\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['interest_loan_ratio'] = df['net_interest_amt'] / df['loan_cap_amt']\n",
    "Why?: This ratio helps identify if the interest charged on a loan is disproportionate to the loan cap. Under RegZ, the interest rate and charges must be clear, and if this ratio is high, it could indicate an APR disclosure issue.\n",
    "How it helps: Detects excessively high interest relative to the loan cap, which could indicate undisclosed APR violations.\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['trans_interest_ratio'] = df['transaction_amount'] / df['net_interest_amt']\n",
    "Why?: This ratio helps to gauge the transparency of APR disclosures. If the transaction amount is significantly higher than the net interest amount, it may indicate that the APR is being disclosed in a misleading way.\n",
    "How it helps: Highlights situations where APR disclosures might be manipulated or misrepresented, potentially violating RegZ.\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['loan_cap_change'] = df['loan_cap_amt'].diff().fillna(0)\n",
    "Why?: RegZ requires that the terms of the loan, including the loan cap, be disclosed clearly. A sudden or unannounced change in the loan cap could be a violation of RegZ.\n",
    "How it helps: Helps detect any unexpected changes in loan caps that might not be disclosed properly to the consumer, indicating a possible RegZ violation.\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "df['trans_fee_association'] = (df['transaction_amount'] > 1000) & (df['ca_fee_amt'] > 50)\n",
    "Why?: Frequent itemsets between transaction amount and fees above certain thresholds could indicate unusual fee structures or hidden charges that violate RegZ rules. If larger transaction amounts are associated with disproportionately high fees, this could be indicative of non-disclosure.\n",
    "How it helps: Identifies potentially misleading fee structures for large transactions that could violate RegZ if not properly disclosed.\n",
    "2. Transaction Amount + Loan Cap + Interest Amount Patterns\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['trans_loan_interest_association'] = (df['transaction_amount'] > 1000) & (df['loan_cap_amt'] > 5000) & (df['net_interest_amt'] > 200)\n",
    "Why?: The combination of high transaction amounts, large loan caps, and high interest amounts may indicate loans with high APRs. RegZ requires that these rates be transparently disclosed.\n",
    "How it helps: Identifies high-risk transactions where loan terms may be non-compliant or APR is not clearly disclosed.\n",
    "3. Transaction Type + Fee Amount Association\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['trans_type_fee_association'] = (df['trans_type_id'] == 'cash_advance') & (df['ca_fee_amt'] > 50)\n",
    "Why?: Certain transaction types, such as cash advances, are often subject to higher fees. RegZ mandates that these fee structures are disclosed clearly. This feature detects whether specific transaction types have unusually high fees.\n",
    "How it helps: Highlights cases where specific transaction types might carry hidden fees, potentially violating RegZ.\n",
    "4. Loan Cap Amount + Transaction Amount + Interest Rate Association\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['loan_trans_interest_association'] = (df['loan_cap_amt'] > 10000) & (df['transaction_amount'] > 5000) & (df['net_interest_amt'] > 300)\n",
    "Why?: High-value transactions often correlate with higher loan caps and interest rates. These features may represent loans with higher APRs, which need to be disclosed appropriately under RegZ.\n",
    "How it helps: Flags transactions with large loan caps and high interest amounts, potentially indicating APR violations if the terms are not properly disclosed.\n",
    "5. Transaction Amount + Loan Term + Fee Amount Patterns\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['trans_term_fee_association'] = (df['transaction_amount'] > 5000) & (df['loan_term_months'] > 24) & (df['ca_fee_amt'] > 100)\n",
    "Why?: Loans with longer terms and high fees relative to transaction amounts could suggest improperly disclosed APR or excessive fees, as RegZ requires clear and transparent fee disclosures for longer-term loans.\n",
    "How it helps: Detects high-fee, long-term loans that might not be compliant with RegZ transparency requirements.\n",
    "6. Transaction Type + Loan Cap Amount + Interest Amount\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['trans_type_loan_interest_association'] = (df['trans_type_id'] == 'credit_purchase') & (df['loan_cap_amt'] > 5000) & (df['net_interest_amt'] > 200)\n",
    "Why?: This association detects patterns where specific transaction types, such as credit purchases, are paired with higher loan caps and interest amounts. If these combinations appear frequently in the data, it might indicate improper APR disclosure under RegZ.\n",
    "How it helps: Flags transactions where interest and loan terms might be manipulated or not disclosed according to RegZ.\n",
    "7. Frequent Itemsets Based on Loan Cap and Transaction Amount\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['loan_trans_association'] = (df['loan_cap_amt'] > 10000) & (df['transaction_amount'] > 2000)\n",
    "Why?: Combinations of high loan caps and large transaction amounts may signify loans with higher APRs. If such combinations occur frequently, it might be worth examining whether these terms are being disclosed properly.\n",
    "How it helps: Highlights loans with large transactions and high caps, which are more likely to involve significant APR terms.\n",
    "8. Fee Amount + Loan Term Association\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['fee_term_association'] = (df['ca_fee_amt'] > 50) & (df['loan_term_months'] > 24)\n",
    "Why?: RegZ mandates that fees be properly disclosed over the life of the loan. If long-term loans consistently have higher fees, it might point to hidden or improperly disclosed APRs.\n",
    "How it helps: Detects patterns where long-term loans are associated with higher fees, which could indicate RegZ violations in APR disclosures.\n",
    "9. Transaction Amount + Loan Cap + Fee Amount Interaction\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "df['trans_loan_fee_interaction'] = (df['transaction_amount'] > 5000) & (df['loan_cap_amt'] > 10000) & (df['ca_fee_amt'] > 100)\n",
    "Why?: The interaction between high transaction amounts, loan caps, and fees could suggest a problematic structure that may lead to violations of RegZ if APR disclosures are unclear or deceptive.\n",
    "How it helps: Identifies potentially hidden or undisclosed fees and APR-related issues by analyzing the interactions between high transaction amounts, loan caps, and fees.\n",
    "Steps to Generate These Features:\n",
    "Preprocess Data: Ensure that all numerical features (e.g., transaction_amount, loan_cap_amt, net_interest_amt) are binarized or thresholded as needed to create discrete variables. For categorical features (e.g., trans_type_id), perform one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply FP-Growth: Use the fpgrowth function from the mlxtend library on your preprocessed dataset to find frequent itemsets based on selected thresholds (e.g., transaction amounts above a certain threshold).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate Association Rules: Apply the association_rules function to extract rules with metrics like lift, support, and confidence. These rules help identify strong relationships between variables that are highly correlated, which can then be transformed into new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Binary Features: Based on the frequent itemsets, create binary features for each identified itemset. This is done by checking if a transaction contains the items in the itemset and setting the feature value to 1 if it does, and 0 otherwise."

    "For RegZ compliance and APR (Annual Percentage Rate) calculations, we need to focus on identifying thresholds and statistical features that could help assess if transactions are adhering to the regulations set out by Regulation Z. These thresholds can be based on statistical analyses that highlight unusual or non-compliant behaviors in the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why it helps: According to RegZ, the APR is influenced by loan amounts and their fees. If the transaction amount exceeds a certain percentage of the loan cap, it could indicate that the consumer might be exposed to unreasonably high interest rates, affecting the APR calculation.\n",

    "To create a statistical approach for anomaly detection based on the features we’ve discussed (fee-to-interest ratio, APR deviation from loan cap, balance transfer fee relative to balance transfer amount, etc.), we can use statistical methods like Z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), and confidence intervals. Here's how to approach anomaly detection based on the 9 rule-based features we derived:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-by-Step Approach:\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "Before applying any anomaly detection methods, ensure that the data is clean and preprocessed.\n",
    "Remove any null values or outliers that may affect the statistical calculations.\n",
    "Normalize features where required, especially if features have different units (e.g., fees, amounts, APR).\n",
    "2. Z-Score Method for Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. If the Z-score is large (above a threshold like 2 or 3), it can be considered an anomaly.\n",
    "For each of the 9 features:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑍\n",
    "=\n",
    "𝑋\n",
    "−\n",
    "𝜇\n",
    "𝜎\n",
    "Z= \n",
    "σ\n",
    "X−μ\n",
    "​\n",
    " \n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑋\n",
    "X is the data point\n",
    "𝜇\n",
    "μ is the mean of the feature\n",
    "𝜎\n",
    "σ is the standard deviation of the feature\n",
    "A Z-score > 3 or Z-score < -3 indicates an anomaly (depending on the direction of the feature, it could be either too high or too low).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Assuming `df` has the columns for all the calculated features:\n",
    "features = [\n",

    "Statistical Justification: The Z-score method helps flag values that deviate significantly from the mean of the feature distribution, which is a clear indication of anomalies in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. IQR (Interquartile Range) Method for Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "The IQR method detects outliers by measuring the spread between the 1st quartile (Q1) and 3rd quartile (Q3) of the data distribution. Values that lie outside the range:\n",

    "Statistical Justification: The IQR method is based on the assumption that normal data points should lie within a certain range of values. Outliers or anomalies are those that fall outside this range, thus identifying them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Confidence Interval Method for Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "The Confidence Interval (CI) method calculates the range where a given percentage of the data points should lie. For a 95% Confidence Interval, the range would be mean ± 1.96 * standard deviation.\n",
    "Implementation Example:\n",

    "df['CI_anomaly_flag'] = df['CI_anomaly_flag'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 0 else 0)\n",
    "Statistical Justification: Confidence intervals provide a range where we expect the data to lie with a certain confidence (e.g., 95% confidence). Data points outside this range can be considered anomalies, indicating that something is wrong or unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Rule-Based Anomaly Prediction:\n",
    "Once you apply these methods (Z-score, IQR, Confidence Interval), you can integrate them into a rule-based system where you define anomaly detection based on a combination of these methods. For instance, if any of the anomaly flags for a feature exceed a certain threshold, the transaction can be flagged as anomalous.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Combine all anomaly flags into a final decision\n",
    "df['final_anomaly_flag'] = (df['anomaly_flag'] | df['IQR_anomaly_flag'] | df['CI_anomaly_flag']).astype(int)\n",
    "Final Model:\n",
    "Anomaly Flag: If any of the above methods flag a value as anomalous (based on thresholds), the transaction is flagged as anomalous.\n",
    "Confidence Level: By calculating the Z-score or using IQR thresholds, we can assign a confidence level to each anomaly flag.\n",
    "6. Evaluation:\n",
    "Precision, Recall, F1-score: If you have labeled data, evaluate the performance of the anomaly detection using standard classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "ROC-AUC Curve: If you have a binary classification task, evaluate the model’s performance using ROC-AUC.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "By combining Z-scores, IQR, and confidence intervals, you can create a rule-based anomaly detection system that effectively flags anomalies in transaction data related to RegZ compliance (e.g., APR calculation). These statistical methods offer a solid, interpretable foundation for detecting anomalies that might indicate misleading APR disclosures, excessive fees, or other non-compliance issues, helping to ensure regulatory compliance in financial transactions."
