Use Case: Reg Z Compliance with Updated Profitability Dataset
Objective:
To identify anomalies in Annual Percentage Rate (APR) reevaluation for eligible accounts, ensuring compliance with Regulation Z (Reg Z), which mandates accurate APR reevaluation for eligible accounts to avoid regulatory fines.

Data Used:
Dataset: Updated Profitability Dataset
Key Variables:
cash goto apr rt (cash advance APR rate)
amort balcon fee amt new (amortized balance on fee amount)
late fees (late payment charges)
total all fees amt (total fees incurred by the account)
total net fees amt (total net fees after rebates/adjustments)
net interest amt (net interest charged)
nim amt (net interest margin)
prior purch amt (prior month's purchase amount)
lst pymt dte (date of last payment)
interest (interest charged)
return amt (returned purchase amount)
total credit limit (total credit line of the customer)
ca amt (cash advance amount)
cash adv fee (fees associated with cash advances)
aff rebate (affiliate rebate amount)
Solution:
1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Analyze distributions of key variables (e.g., cash goto apr rt, total net fees amt, nim amt) to identify outliers.
Check missing values and correlations between variables like APR, fees, and payment patterns.
Visualize time-based trends in lst pymt dte and its relation to late fees or interest accumulation.
2. Feature Engineering: Generate new features to identify patterns indicative of non-compliance or anomalies:

Feature Name	Formula/Description	Relevance
days_since_last_payment	(Current Date - lst pymt dte)	Captures delayed payments; relates to late fees and potential APR violations.
fee_to_limit_ratio	total all fees amt / total credit limit	High ratios could indicate excessive fees compared to the credit limit.
avg_cash_advance_fee	cash adv fee / ca amt	Indicates disproportionate fees on cash advances.
interest_efficiency	interest / net interest amt	Measures if interest aligns with net interest margin, signaling unusual APR adjustments.
prior_to_current_purchase_ratio	prior purch amt / purch amt	Identifies significant changes in purchasing behavior, which could affect APR reevaluation.
revenue_fee_ratio	revenue amortized amt / total all fees amt	Assesses if revenue aligns with fees charged; deviations could indicate overcharging.
credit_limit_utilization	(purch amt + ca amt) / total credit limit	Measures how much credit is being utilized; anomalies here could affect APR.
late_fee_frequency	Count(late fees) / Total Periods	Tracks the frequency of late fees, which could impact APR adjustments.
high_cash_advance_flag	1 if ca amt > threshold else 0	Flags accounts with unusually high cash advances.
returned_purchase_ratio	return amt / purch amt	Highlights frequent returns, potentially causing miscalculations in APR or fees.
bad_check_to_fee_ratio	bad chk fee / total net fees amt	Indicates accounts with higher-than-average bad check fees.
3. Anomaly Detection Methodology:

Modeling: Use unsupervised machine learning techniques:

Isolation Forest: To detect outliers based on APR rates and fee patterns.
DBSCAN: For clustering accounts with similar APR and transaction behavior, identifying irregular groups.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): For dimensionality reduction and visualization of anomalies.
Non-Modeling:

Rule-Based Logic:
Accounts with fee_to_limit_ratio > 0.2.
days_since_last_payment > 90 triggering late fees without APR adjustments.
returned_purchase_ratio > 0.5, indicating potential APR miscalculation.

6. Results & Impacts:

Number of anomalies detected: Quantified from model outputs.
Potential financial impact: Aggregated from features like total all fees amt and cash adv fee for flagged accounts.

Why Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)?
EDA helps uncover patterns, anomalies, relationships, and summary statistics in the data, providing valuable insights into its structure and quality. For the Profitability Dataset, EDA is crucial to:

Understand Variable Distributions: Examine the spread of numerical variables (e.g., cash goto apr rt, total credit limit) to identify outliers, skewness, or irregularities that may impact downstream analyses.
Detect Missing or Erroneous Data: Identify gaps or errors (e.g., NaN, inconsistent date formats) that could distort feature engineering or modeling efforts.
Correlations and Relationships: Analyze how variables like net interest amt, late fees, and total all fees amt relate to each other and identify critical predictors for APR anomalies.
Segmentation Opportunities: Segment data based on variables like temp key, prior purch amt, or total credit limit to identify unique patterns in customer behavior.
Feature Suitability: Validate whether variables such as interest, purch amt, or cash adv fee are informative for detecting anomalies and compliance risks.
Detailed EDA Plan for the Profitability Dataset
1. Summarize the Dataset:

Analyze dimensions (rows, columns).
List and count categorical and numerical variables.
Summarize key statistics (mean, median, std, min, max).
2. Missing Value Analysis:

Assess missing value percentages.
Decide on imputation or exclusion strategies.
3. Distribution Analysis:

Plot histograms for variables like total credit limit, interest, and net interest amt.
Use boxplots to highlight outliers in late fees and cash goto apr rt.
4. Correlation Analysis:

Compute Pearson/Spearman correlation matrices for continuous variables.
Identify highly correlated variables (e.g., net interest amt vs. interest).
5. Date and Temporal Patterns:

Analyze lst pymt dte for patterns in payment behavior.
Plot trends for late fees and total all fees amt over time.
6. Group-Level Summaries:

Group by temp key or customer segments and analyze aggregated metrics.
Example: Compare total credit limit vs. net interest amt across accounts.
7. Identify Potential Issues:

Highlight unusual values in variables like cash adv fee and return amt.
Check for logical inconsistencies (e.g., negative purch amt).

How This Helps:
Variable Understanding: By visualizing distributions and summary statistics, you can identify variables with extreme values (e.g., high APR rates or unusual fees).
Anomaly Identification: Outliers in cash goto apr rt or total credit limit can hint at potential issues with APR reevaluations or mismanagement.
Feature Relationships: Correlation and scatterplots reveal interactions between fees, credit limits, and interest, providing insights for feature engineering.
Error Detection: Missing values, logical inconsistencies, or negative values (e.g., total all fees amt) can indicate data quality issues requiring correction.
Temporal Patterns: Analysis of lst pymt dte can uncover delays in payments leading to late fees or APR adjustments.
This EDA lays a strong foundation for anomaly detection and compliance checks by ensuring data quality, identifying patterns, and understanding relationships critical for Reg Z compliance. Let me know if you'd like to proceed to the next phase or explore more variables!
